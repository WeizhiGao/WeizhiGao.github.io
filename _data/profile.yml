  <p>
    I am currently a PhD student in Department of Computer Science of NCSU, under the supervision 
    of <a href="https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/xiaorui/" target="_blank">bicolor Xiaorui Liu</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are various patterns of a bicolour cat. These range from the Van-patterned (colour on the crown of the head 
    and the tail only) to a solid colour with a throat locket or medallion. Bicolour coats are found in many cat breeds, 
    as well as being common in domestic longhair and domestic shorthair cats.
