    I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at 
    <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">North Carolina State University</a> (NCSU), 
    under the supervision of 
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/xiaorui/" target="_blank">Xiaorui Liu</a>. 
    My research mainly focuses on trustworthy deep learning. 
    I received my master's degree in applied mathematics at the 
    <a href="https://www.ucas.ac.cn/" target="_blank">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, 
    where I was advised by 
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CpmL7BkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Yingjie Tian</a>. 
    I earned my bachelor's degree in mathematics at 
    <a href="https://english.bnu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Beijing Normal University</a>, 
    advised by 
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mqruBEQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Huajie Chen</a>.
